## Chapter 1
Learning from Mistakes is overrated
  - You know what *not* to do, but you still don't know what you *should* do
  - Learning from Success is key

Why Grow?
  - Have lots of employees doesn't necessarily translate to success
  - Having a small team can often times lead to more efficient processes and less bloat
