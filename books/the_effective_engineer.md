## 1) Focus on High-Leverage Activities
- Leverage = Impact / Time

## 2) Optimize for Learning
- Adopt a Growth Mindset - avoid a Fixed Mindset
- Learning is like compound investing
- Seek out work environments conductive to Learning
  - Training
  - Pace
  - Openness
  - People / Talent
  - Autonomy

## 3) Prioritize Regularly
- Prioritize ideas based on estimated returns on investment
- Have a checklist of "to-do's"
  - checklists reduce errors in every field
- Focus on what directly produces *value*

- Focus on the important and non-urgent
  - Quadrant 2 items provide significant value in the long term
  - Carve out time to invest in skill development
- Protect your Maker's schedule
  - getting into *flow* or *rhythm* takes around 10-15 minutes of uninterrupted concentration
  - preserve large chunks of your schedule into "focus blocks", reducing context-switches

## 4) Invest in iteration speed
- **Continuous deployment** when automated with QA testing is vital to velocity
  - CI allows for small, incremental changes rather than large, batched updates
  - Smaller iterations cause less overhead and context switching
  - Easier to debug changes as changes are minor and small
  - Avoid 'merge hell' that is associated with infrequent, large releases
 
- Move Fast to Learn Fast
  - the faster you iterate, the faster you learn what works and what doesn't work
