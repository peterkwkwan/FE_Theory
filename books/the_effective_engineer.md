## 1) Focus on High-Leverage Activities
- Leverage = Impact / Time

## 2) Optimize for Learning
- Adopt a Growth Mindset - avoid a Fixed Mindset
- Learning is like compound investing
- Seek out work environments conductive to Learning
  - Training
  - Pace
  - Openness
  - People / Talent
  - Autonomy

## 3) Prioritize Regularly
- Prioritize ideas based on estimated returns on investment
- Have a checklist of "to-do's"
  - checklists reduce errors in every field
- Focus on what directly produces *value*

- Focus on the important and non-urgent
  - Quadrant 2 items provide significant value in the long term
  - Carve out time to invest in skill development
- Protect your Maker's schedule
  - getting into *flow* or *rhythm* takes around 10-15 minutes of uninterrupted concentration
  - preserve large chunks of your schedule into "focus blocks", reducing context-switches

## 4) Invest in iteration speed
- **Continuous deployment** when automated with QA testing is vital to velocity
  - CI allows for small, incremental changes rather than large, batched updates
  - Smaller iterations cause less overhead and context switching
  - Easier to debug changes as changes are minor and small
  - Avoid 'merge hell' that is associated with infrequent, large releases
 
- Move Fast to Learn Fast
  - the faster you iterate, the faster you learn what works and what doesn't work

- Invest in Time-Saving Tools
  - tools that save time will have a force-multiplier effect
  - empower you and your team to ship and deploy faster
 
- Master Your Programming Environment
  - Get proficient with your favorite text editor or IDE
  - Learn at least one productive, high-level programming language
  - Get familiar with UNIX (or Windows) shell commands
    - Learn basic commands like _grep_, _sort_, _uniq_, _wc_, _awk_, _sed_, _xargs_ and _find_
  - Automate your manual workflows
 

## 5) Measure What You Want to Improve
- Use Metrics to Drive Progress
  - If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it
