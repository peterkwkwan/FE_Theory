# ARRAYS

### RAM
- ram stores data in bytes
    - a byte is 8 bits
    - each bit can store a zero (0) or one (1)
  
- two components to RAM
  - VALUE and ADDRESS
    
- How can we store arrays in memory?
  - each element in array is stored as a series of bits
  - elements in an array are always contiguous, meaning they are adjacent to each other
