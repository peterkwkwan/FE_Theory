### HTML Questions

> What does a `doctype` do?

- All HTML documents must start with a `DOCTYPE` declaration
- It is NOT an HTML tag, but rather an indicator to the browser of what type of document to expect, along with the version of HTML
- Ensures the document is parsed consistently across different browsers
  **Note**: doctype is not case-sensitive

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
