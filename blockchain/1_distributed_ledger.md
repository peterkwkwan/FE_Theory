# Distributed Ledger

Blockchain technology is a combination of a _decentralized, distributed ledger_ with _cryptography_

### Decentralized

In centralized systems, there could be a single point of failure which brings the whole network down

Being decentralized means an increase in the number of points of failure.

- if one _node_ (server on a blockchain) encounters an issue (hack or failure), the blockchain continues to run smoothly
- hundreds, or thousands of other nodes are still continuing to host the blockchain
- Likewise, if one of the nodes got hacked and had its data changed, it would only affect the hacked node, in turn allowing all the other blockchain nodes to easily pinpoint the suspicious node and remove it from the blockchain.

### Distributed

Distributed system can store or process data in different locations. A distributed ledger therefore has the same ledger that is stored in multiple locations.

However, being distributed does not necessarily mean it is a decentralized system.

Distributed =/= Decentralized
