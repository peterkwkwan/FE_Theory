# Cryptography

Is a technique used to storage of data through *encryption* ('scrambling' of information)
- ensures that only the sender and intended recipient of a message can view its contents
- "The Imitation Game" - cracking the German's Enigma machine

The process of transforming some set of data into random values that _can't be reversed_ is called *hashing*
- Many sites use this technique to store user passwords

Encryption vs Hashing
- Encryption is a two-way process
