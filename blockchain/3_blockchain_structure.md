# Blockchain structure

Combining what we learned about decentralization, distributed ledger technology and cryptography, we can now dive into blockchain

Blockchain exists virutally / digitally, it is not physical

- however, we can use a visual representation of _blocks_ to help us understand the blockchain concept

### Blocks

The blocks of the blockchain contain the _data_ of the _ledger_

The blocks are _chained_ together through _cryptography_

#### Blockchain network

If we only had _1_ copy of the blockchain, this would be a centralized ledger

- in order to achieve decentralization, we need more than 1
- this is why we refer to blockchains as having their own network (of ledgers)

A blockchain will have multiple participants, known as _nodes_

- nodes all have a copy of the ledger

A _blockchain network_ is therefore a network of distributed, decentralized nodes who all possess the same ledger of data
