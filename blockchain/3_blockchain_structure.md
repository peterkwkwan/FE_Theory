# Blockchain structure

Combining what we learned about decentralization, distributed ledger technology and cryptography, we can now dive into blockchain

Blockchain exists virutally / digitally, it is not physical

- however, we can use a visual representation of _blocks_ to help us understand the blockchain concept

### Blocks

The blocks of the blockchain contain the _data_ of the _ledger_

The blocks are _chained_ together through \*cryptography
