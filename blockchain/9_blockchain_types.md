# Blockchain Types

There are 4 main types of blockchains

### #1 - Public

- __permissionless__
    - everybody has equal rights and ability to participate
- no central authority
- Advantages:
    - completely decentralized
    - anonymous nature
    - democratic network by public
    - immutable
    - full transparency
- Disadvantages:
    - potential for illegal activities
    - unregulated
    - slow speeds


### #2 - Private
- __permissioned__
    - controlled by a central authority
    - authority determines who can become a node/participant in the network
- Advantages:
    - speed (fewer participants, less time in consensus)
    - privacy
    - maintenance
    - regulated / rules
- Disadvantages:
    - centralized
    - corporate corruption


### #3 - Consortium
- __permissioned__ blockchain ruled by a group of organizations
- useful when trust and security is required in collaborative efforts
    - slightly more decentralized than private blockchains
    - however, it is costly and requires more logistical effort among participants


### #4 - Hybrid
- able to decide who participates as well as who can view the transactions
- mostly used by enterprise level businesses for solving specific business needs
