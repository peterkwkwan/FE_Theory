# Why use Blockchain?

### Decentralization

> transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (organization, individual, group) to a distributed network

#### Modern Bank as an example

A centralized platform where we keep all our money

- a _centralized_ ledger that keeps track of all transactions
- we trust the bank to keep our money safe, make transactions, set up credit cards and receive interest from the bank. Great! Right?

Why would banks do this?

- reinvest our money that we give them, in hopes of generating an income

However, using a bank's services has costs (both apparent & hidden)

1. Transaction fees
2. Privacy issues
3. Transaction time
4. Eligibility proof
5. Banks work independently
6. Human error or malicious intent
7. Centralized vulnerability
