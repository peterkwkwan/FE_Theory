# Maintaining the blockchain

Once the transactions are verified and the blocks are filled, they are ready to be officially added to the blockchain.

There are, however, thousands of transactions being initiated around the world every second. We can assume that different nodes will have a different order of transactions inside their respective blocks. 

Once all these blocks are filled with transactions, it begs the question - which block gets the right to be chosen and added to the blockchain first?

> The choosing process is called the _consensus mechanism_. It indicates _how_ the blockchain network comes to a consensus regarding which block gets added to the blockchain.
