# Case Studies

## Walmart
- large scale multinational retail and wholesale business, over 10,000 stores worldwide
- famous for wide range of products at low prices
    - this is possible due to their expertise in supply chain management
    - their supply chain reaches more than 100,000 suppliers globally

However, increasing load of supply chain management has made Walmart Canada a victim of a common problem in the logistics industry - data discrepencies for freight carriers
- Walmart Canada delivers over 500,000 shipments annually
- works with over 70 third-party freight carriers

Freight carrier delivery invoice tracks many data points (over 200), such as stop locations, fuel consumption, time zones, etc.
- this set of consolidated complex data makes discrepencies inevitable
- large part of problem was due to Walmart Canada and 3rd party freight carriers using different data systems, which made data reconciliation difficult

Walmart Canada sought the help of DLT Labs, a 3rd party blockchain solution provider, to create a system where data could be efficiently recorded and provided for relevant parties that were involved
- in 2021, a blockchain network called DLT Freightk was released to all 3rd party freight carriers
- the network gathers info at every step of the delivery process, from tender offer to proof of delivery to payment
- info gathered by all parties is synced to the network directly and accessible by all participants
- solution was a huge success and reduced the need for data reconciliation from 70% of the invoices to less than 1% today
