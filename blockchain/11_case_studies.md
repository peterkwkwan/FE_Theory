# Case Studies

## Walmart
- large scale multinational retail and wholesale business, over 10,000 stores worldwide
- famous for wide range of products at low prices
    - this is possible due to their expertise in supply chain management
    - their supply chain reaches more than 100,000 suppliers globally

However, increasing load of supply chain management has made Walmart Canada a victim of a common problem in the logistics industry - data discrepencies for freight carriers
- Walmart Canada delivers over 500,000 shipments annually
- works with over 70 third-party freight carriers

Freight carrier delivery invoice tracks many data points (over 200), such as stop locations, fuel consumption, time zones, etc.
- this set of consolidated complex data makes discrepencies inevitable
- large part of problem was due to Walmart Canada and 3rd party freight carriers using different data systems, which made data reconciliation difficult
