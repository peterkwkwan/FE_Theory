# The Longest Chain

### Block Validation Recap
All nodes on the blockchain network carry a copy of the blockchain. Nodes who participate in the mining process race towards producing the correct hash to add their new block of transactions onto the chain. When they win this race, the winning block is broadcasted towards the network, where _all other nodes stop what they are doing, check that the winning block is valid and add it onto their copy of the blockchain_.
