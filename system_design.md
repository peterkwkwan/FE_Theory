## Basic server-client flow

1. Users access websites through domain names, such as www.example.com. Usually, the Domain Name System (DNS) is a paid service provided by 3rd parties and not hosted by our servers.
2. Internet Protocol (IP) address is returned to the browser or mobile app. In the example, IP address 15.125.23.214 is returned.
3. Once the IP address is obtained, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests are sent directly to your web server.
4. The web server returns HTML pages or JSON response for rendering.
